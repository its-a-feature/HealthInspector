# HealthInspector
JXA situational awareness helper by simply reading specific files on a filesystem

## Purpose
Health Inspector is designed to help provide some additional situation awareness for operations on macOS by doing a lot of discovery by simply reading PLIST files or other files on disk that any user can read. I wanted to find another way to do discovery in JXA and macOS in general without having to spawn a bunch of bash commands.

## Execution
To run the functions within HealthInspector with Apfell, use the `jsimport` and `jsimport_call` functions within the `apfell-jxa` payload. When you run `jsimport_call` be sure to specify the function you want to execute afterwards, such as: `jsimport_call All_Checks()`. 

If you want to execute this outside of an Apfell apfell-jxa payload, you can execute it with osascript:
`osascript HealthInspector.js`. You will need to append to the bottom of the script the function you want to call though. The script itself is just a list of functions.

A lot of these functions are user specific. If you're running as `root` or another user and want to get this information for a specific user, simply supply the username to the function call as follows: `jsimport_call All_Checks({user: "itsafeature"});`
